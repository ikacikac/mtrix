# Mtrix - Tetris clone in Python


Hello there!

This is my Tetris clone implemented using:
 * pygame
 * blinker
 * Python2.7

## Installation

To install Mtrix just clone this git repository and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

After pygame and blinker packages are installed you are ready to play!

## Run the game

After installinga all you have to do is run `mtrix.py` by typing `python mtrix.py`.

## Folder structure

Game logic and media are separated in few folders. Here is a brief description of what is contained in them:
 * `game` - holds all Python scripts that are managing game logic and configuration,
 * `media` - holds media files (icon file at the moment),
 * `utils` - holds `Vect2D` class and Blinker's events.
